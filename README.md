Let us be honest folks the facts speak for themselves the work force within design in the UK remains overflown with men **3/4** higher than the **53%** national average. Women Compared to their male. Equals are likely to be paid **17%** less and are less likely to be seen in a managerial position

For black Asians or minority ethnic backgrounds they make up just a dismal **13%** of jobs and it gets worse as senior positions are measly **12%** of ethnic staff. If you thought the Sitch couldn’t get any worse the pay gap could range up to **17%**

<p> How can we pacify this ongoing problem I hear you cry, I am no expert and these are only suggestions?

* Internship programs to attract more diverse talent and to expand the pool of creatives with different backgrounds and perspectives PS no experience or age limit is needed just passion.

* Let’s start practising conscious inclusion, let’s ask ourselves what voices are missing and give them an opportunity to be heard and most importantly included 
* Support and embrace diversity on all levels, no one wants to be a quarter or a bottom on a seat it’s Dehumanising and reduces represented groups as a mere statistic  ***ain’t nobody got time for that***.
* Stop hiring friends, our friends often have similar views, putting friends forward for jobs encourages management to hire someone who is just like you, stagnating the diversity pool.

* Mentoring! Commitment dedication and time is required for this but she is in a mental who is a different ethnicity gender nationality age race or culture open doors to alternative view and opinion.

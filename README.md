# Graphic design not designed for diversity.


# ***“The ends you serve that are selfish will take you no further than yourself but the ends you serve that are for all, in common, will take you into eternity.” #***
###### Marcus Garvey 


Facts speak for themselves the graphic design industry in the UK remains overflown with men **3/4** higher than the **53%** national average. Women Compared to their male equals are likely to be paid **17%** less and are less likely to be seen in a managerial position.

For black Asians or minority ethnic backgrounds they only make up a dismal **13%** of jobs and as senior positions a measly **12%** of ethnic staff. If you thought the Sitch, could not get any worse the pay gap could range up to **17%** 


<p> How can we pacify this ongoing problem I hear you cry before I start, I need you to know I am no expert and these are only suggestions? 

* Internship programs to attract more diverse talent and to expand the pool of creatives with diverse backgrounds and perspectives PS no experience or age limit is needed just passion.
 


 


* Let us start practising conscious inclusion, let’s ask ourselves what voices are missing and give them an opportunity to be heard and most importantly included.

 * Support and embrace diversity on all levels, no one wants to be just a bum on a seat and a quota it is dehumanising, and reduces represented groups as a mere statistic, ***ain’t nobody got time for that***.
 
 
* Stop hiring friends, our friends often have similar views, putting friends forward for jobs encourages management to hire someone who is just like you, stagnating the diversity pool.




* Mentoring! Commitment, dedication, and time is required for this role, and if you have all these why not. Just make sure you choose someone with a different ethnicity, gender, nationality, age, and race this opens doors to alternative but needed point of view and opinions.

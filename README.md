# Graphic design not designed for diversity.


“The ends you serve that are selfish will take you no further than yourself but the ends you serve that are for all, in common, will take you into eternity.” 
###### Marcus Garvey 

#  see a problem in this design,
 

#  The design of visual communication. 
 

# I hear this message loud and clear, there is no room for me in this career, 
 
 
# No key. 
 
#  The door is closed. 

# If I impose only unlucky 13 is the percentage for me. 
 
# Passionate about Communication, and problem solving. 
 
# Luckily, the times are always evolving, 
 
# I am more optimistic than ever before here are some key points how to ajar this closed door. 













###### Conscious inclusion to remove the illusion that we are not missing diverse voices. 

###### No one wants to be a bum on the seat to repeat a false Status quo embrace diversity on all levels. 

##### Stop hiring friends, they have similar views to you, and may continue to choose these same views and stagnant the diversity pool. 
 
##### Design is not a dictatorship so let us welcome internships to those you assume the shoe does not fit.
